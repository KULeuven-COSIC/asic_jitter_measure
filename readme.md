# ASIC Jitter Measurement Set-up

This is a reference implementation for on-chip ASIC jitter measurement, making use of Delay Chains (DCs).

## Archive Structure

This archive contains the following folders:
- *measurements*: Contains measurement data for the ASIC implementation.
- *hardware*: Contains netlist and layout views of the ASIC implementation.
- *figures*: Contains Python scripts to generate the figures in the publication below and visualizes the data in the *measurement* folder.
- *lib*: Contains helper Python scripts and figure generation options.
